                                                                               Pythagorean Expectation
                                                                               
           The pythagorean expectation is the relationship between wins and runs, goals, and other criteria.
           The pythagorean theorem states that the percentage of games won by a team in a season is directly proportional to 
           (points/runs/goals scored by the team)^2/(Points/runs/goals scored by opponenet)^2
           
           This model worked well for the football, basketball and baseball data set, but not great for cricket.
